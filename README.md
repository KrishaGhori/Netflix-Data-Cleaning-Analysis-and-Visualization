# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-and-Visualization

📌 Netflix Data Analysis Project
A complete end-to-end analytics project where I performed data cleaning & exploration using Python (Pandas) and created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize insights from the Netflix dataset.

📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding content patterns on Netflix—movies, TV shows, genres, ratings, release trends, and more.

The workflow includes:
 1. Data Cleaning using Pandas
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 3. Feature Engineering
 4. Interactive Dashboard in Power BI
 5. Insights & Conclusions

🧹 1. Data Cleaning (Python – Pandas)
Performed preprocessing and cleaning tasks:
-Removed duplicates
-Handled missing values
-Converted date_added to datetime format
-Extracted release year, month, duration, and duration type
-Cleaned text columns (title, director, cast, country)
-Split multiple-genre entries
-Created new calculated fields for better visualization

🔎 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key EDA steps:
-Count of Movies vs TV Shows
-Most frequent genres
-Country-wise content distribution
-Ratings analysis
-Trend of content released per year
-Descriptive statistics for duration

📊 3. Power BI Dashboard
Created an interactive dashboard including:
-Movies vs TV Shows breakdown
-Genre/category distribution
-Top contributing countries
-Releases over years (trend line)
-Ratings distribution
-Duration analysis for movies & shows

Dashboard Tools Used :
-Power BI Desktop
-DAX for calculated measures
-Power Query Editor for minor transformations

📈 5. Key Insights
-Movies dominate Netflix’s content library.
-Certain genres like International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies appear most frequently.
-The US, India, and the UK are the top content producers.
-Content release peaked between 2017–2020.
-TV Shows have consistent season-based durations, while Movies vary widely.

🛠 Technologies Used
-Python: Pandas, Matplotlib
-Jupyter Notebook
-Power BI: DAX, Power Query
-GitHub for project documentation

📌 6. How to Use This Project
-Clone the repository
-Open the Jupyter notebook for data cleaning
-Open the Power BI .pbix file to explore the dashboard
-Review screenshots if you don’t have Power BI installed
